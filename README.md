# SGF Jupyter Notebook submission example

This repository contains an example of how a SAS Global Forum proceedings entry could look as a Jupyter notebook. It contains the following items:

* `README.md` - This file
* `4419-2020.pdf` - The actual SGF **2020** proceedings paper by Jennifer Waller :)
* `4419-2020 A Beginners Guide to using ARRAYs and DO Loops.ipynb` - The notebook version of Jenn's paper.

This repository is, I hope, a work in progress.
